# We've Got Poems

## Descrition

We've Got Poems is a web application that allows users to create and share poems.

We've Got Poems is a POC : Proof Of Concept. It is a project that aims to be a showcase of some technologies:

Layer 8 : A suite of network protocol implementations that sum to create an anonymizing reverse proxy dedicated to dissociating a user's true identity from their online content choices.

SIWE : Signe in with Ethereum : Sign-In with Ethereum is an authentication standard (EIP-4361) that enables secure communication between a frontend and backend. SIWE is a powerful method for creating user sessions based on a wallet connection, and much more! The example below builds on the Connect Wallet and Sign Message examples.

The canonical repo for Layer8's original Service Provider: "We've Got Poems"
